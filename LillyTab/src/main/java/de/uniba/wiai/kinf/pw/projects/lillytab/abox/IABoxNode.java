/**
 *  {@link IABoxNode}s are the representation of individuals in a description logic tableaux.
 * <p />
 * Nodes are either associated with named individuals or not. If a node is associated with at least one individual, it
 * is called a named node. The set of named individuals is available via {@link #getNames() }.
 * <p />If a node is named, one of the names is the <emph>primary name</emph>
 * of the node. The primary name is available via {@link #getPrimaryName()}. By convention the primary name is the first
 * name in the sorted list of node names.
 * <p />
 * Every ABox node has a set of (possibly complex) concepts (available via {@link #getTerms()
 * }. The individual represented by the ABox node is an instance of these concepts.
 * <p />
 * Additionally, ABox nodes may be linked by <emph>role instances</emph>. A role instance is associated with two ABox
 * nodes and a role name. Role links are maintained in two interdependent maps, the successor map (available via {@link #getSuccessors()
 * }. and the predecessor map (available via {@link #getPredecessors()}.
 * <p />
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Successor and predecessor lists refer to {@link NodeID}s and not {@link IABoxNode}s. This
 * simplifies internal handling, but also represents a leaky abstraction.
 * <p />
 * A node also maintains a list of blocked nodes and conversely also a potential reference to a blocking node. These are
 * used by DL reasoners.
