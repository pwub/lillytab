/**
 * <p>
 *  {@link IABoxNode}s are the representation of individuals in a description logic tableaux.
 * </p><p>
 *   Nodes are either associated with named individuals or not. If a node is associated
 *   with at least one individual, it is called a named node. The set of named individuals
 *	 is available via {@link #getNames() }.
 * </p><p>If a node is named, one of the names is
 *   the <emph>primary name</emph> of the node. The primary name is
 *   available via {@link #getPrimaryName()}. By convention the primary
 *   name is the first name in the sorted list of node names.
 * </p><p>
 *   Every ABox node has a set of (possibly complex) concepts (available via {@link #getTerms() }. The individual
 *   represented by the ABox node is an instance of these concepts.
 * </p><p>
 *   Additionally, ABox nodes may be linked by <emph>role instances</emph>. A role
 *   instance is associated with two ABox nodes and a role name.
 *   Role links are maintained in two interdependent maps,
 *   the successor map (available via {@link #getSuccessors() }.
 *   and the predecessor map (available via {@link #getPredecessors()}.
 * </p><p>
 *   <strong>Note:</strong> Successor and predecessor lists refer to {@link NodeID}s and
 *   not {@link IABoxNode}s. This simplifies internal handling, but also represents a leaky abstraction.
 * </p><p>
 *   A node also maintains a list of blocked nodes and conversely also a potential reference
 *   to a blocking node. These are used by DL reasoners.
 * </p>
